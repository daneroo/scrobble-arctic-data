      Arctic is warming two to four times faster than any other place on the
      planet.  It can significantly affect permafrost, which is crucial to the
      region's ground stability.  This study focuses on a river and lake-rich
      area located near Ikaluktutiak (Cambridge Bay, Nunavut).

      Although little is known of permafrost conditions, local observations
      indicate that episodes  of abrupt and localized permafrost degradation
      have increased in the past decades. Therefore,  it represents a key site
      for studying and monitoring the effects of permafrost thaw on local 
      aquatic ecosystems and northern communities.

      This project aims to detect past and recent indicators of degrading
      permafrost and assess  its impacts on aquatic ecosystems through remote
      sensing, geomorphology, and limnology.  More specifically, this project
      will focus on assessing the hydrological stability of lakes,  analyzing
      variations in lake surfaces over time, and mapping the geomorphological
      origins  and hydrological connectivity of these lakes.

      The stable isotope composition of different water sources, including
      active-layer groundwater  and ground-ice was analysed to assess their
      contributions to sampled lakes and ponds. Our  preliminary results
      revealed diverse lake morphologies, ranging from shallow, flat lakes to 
      deeper lakes with variable bathymetric topography.

      Permafrost cores (1.5 m) indicate high ground ice content with low amounts
      of organic matter.  Turbidity measurements in a tributary of Kitigaq
      River, where subsistence fishing occurs,  indicate above-normal turbidity
      values after the degradation of ice-rich permafrost. These  findings
      highlight the importance of monitoring permafrost degradation in this
      understudied  area since it has implications for both ecosystem health and
      local community.

      Pr. Frédéric Bouchard team from University of Sherbrooke is looking to
      asses  permafrost degradation in the Kitigaq region, based on water
      sampling and  erosion modeling.

      The Multidisciplinary Observatory for Arctic Climate Change and Extreme
      Events Monitoring (MOACC) proposal is submitted by the Université de
      Sherbrooke (lead institution-UdeS), University of Toronto (UofT), Western
      University (WU) and Université de Montréal (UM). The main objective of our
      project is to develop a permanent multidisciplinary scientific
      infrastructure that enables long-term observations of Arctic climate
      change, bringing together experts from a wide range of expertise and
      institutions. The project is led by Prof. Alexandre Langlois (UdeS) and
      Prof. Kimberley Strong (UofT) and responds to a consensus on the lack of
      temporal observations that are crucial to understand feedback processes
      and to promote model development in the Arctic. The innovative aspect of
      this proposal resides in its multidisciplinary approach while enabling
      long-term Arctic measurements spanning several disciplines. The proposed
      observatory will be located at the Canadian High Arctic Research Station
      (CHARS) in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, while enhancing the reach of CHARS with
      linkages to the Environment and Climate Change Canada supersite in
      Iqaluit. Our ambition is to establish the site as one of the largest
      instrumented high Arctic observatories dedicated to the monitoring of key
      indicators that drive climate change. The site will generate and enhance
      partnerships, not only with Canadian research centers and organizations,
      but also with international research partners and networks.

      86% of the world's lakes are covered by ice for at least part of the year.
      However, lakes are undergoing profound changes as a result of climate
      change. The thickness of lake ice is set to decrease, while freshwater
      will be subject to an increased input of allochthonous organic matter due
      to increased water connectivity and anthropogenic activity. Microorganisms
      play key roles in Arctic lake ecosystems, where they are the most abundant
      organisms. However, little is known about ice microbial communities and
      how ice and water microbiomes respond to environmental change. The
      research project in this thesis aims to further characterize Arctic lake
      microorganisms in order to fill the knowledge gap on their activities and
      adaptation to climate disruption. DNA and RNA extracted from the samples
      will be analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The results of this project
      will shed light on the taxonomic diversity and gene expression of Arctic
      lake microbiomes. This will enable us to better anticipate changes linked
      to global warming in these ecosystems, and to develop future strategies
      for preventing or adapting to these changes.
